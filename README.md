# tcia_downloader

This is a very thin wrapper to download and unzip images from the TCIA api. Consider it a pre-alpha version, as anything could break at any time.

To use it, the simple way is to:
* git clone the repo somewhere
* cd to the cloned repo

Now you can use it at the command line:

```bash
python -m src.tcia --help
```

Note that for now you will have to install the dependencies yourself
