# tcia_downloader

This is a very thin wrapper to download and unzip images from the TCIA api. Consider it a pre-alpha version, as anything could break at any time.

To use it, the simple way is to:
* git clone the repo somewhere
* set up a new virtual env
* cd to the cloned repo
* run 'pip install .' to install it locally

Now you can use it at the command line anywhere:

```bash
tcia_dl --help
```

Note that for now you will have to install the dependencies yourself
